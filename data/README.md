You can download all of the data from the paper ["DeepGreen: Deep Learning of Green's Function for Nonlinear Boundary Value Problems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07206) as well as the scripts that create the data from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G77yeFjAguWHPk8QhmH7OMgrmbzn5Imt?usp=sharing). These results must be downloaded in order to run the notebooks in the top-level directory or the scripts in the experiments directory.

If you would like to use DeepGreen on your own data, the training and validation data must be in this directory as .npy files. The training data should consist of two numpy arrays with file names that have the same prefix. One file should contain the discretized forcing functions as rows, and the file name must end in `_train1_f.npy`. The other file should contain the discretized solutions to the boundary value problem as rows, and the file name must end in `_train1_u.npy'. The validation data should be structured similarly but with file names ending in `_val_f.npy` and `_val_u.npy`.
